Concept ✨
You find yourself stranded in a crater on an unknown planet. Your mission is to collect fuel by extracting it from nearby stones
scattered across the environment.

Gameplay 🕹️
Explore the crater to reach stones and extract fuel.

Manage your limited oxygen supply, which adds tension to every expedition.

Oxygen can be refilled at your spaceship, allowing you to continue exploring.

Success depends on balancing exploration, resource collection, and survival.

Purpose 📂
Astro Mania was designed as a learning project to help me understand the fundamentals of Unity, from mechanics and resource
systems to player survival loops. It became my first completed Unity game, marking a major milestone in my development journey.

Status ✅
The project was finished and stands as my first complete Unity game. It represents both a technical achievement and a creative
milestone in my growth as a developer.
